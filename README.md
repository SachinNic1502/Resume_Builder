# React Installation

## Description

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Follow these steps to install React and set up a basic project.

## Installation Steps

1. **Node.js Installation:**
   - React requires Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) to be installed on your system. You can download and install Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Create React App:**
   - React provides a command-line tool called Create React App, which helps you quickly set up a new React project with a predefined folder structure and build scripts.
   - Install Create React App globally by running the following command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     npm install -g create-react-app
     ```

3. **Create a New React Project:**
   - Once Create React App is installed, you can create a new React project by running:
     ```bash
     npx create-react-app my-react-app
     ```
     Replace `my-react-app` with your preferred project name.

4. **Navigate to Project Directory:**
   - After creating the project, navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd my-react-app
     ```

5. **Start Development Server:**
   - To start the development server and see your React app running in the browser, run:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
     This will open your default web browser and display your React app at `http://localhost:3000`.

6. **Start Coding:**
   - You can now start coding your React components and build your application. The changes you make will be automatically reflected in the browser.
